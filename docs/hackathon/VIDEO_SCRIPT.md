## 0:00–0:20 — The Problem (Hook)

"Every year, a trillion dollars worth of food gets thrown away while 783 million people go hungry. That's a billion meals wasted every single day. FoodShare exists to fix that — connecting people with surplus food to those who need it."

**Show:** App icon → splash screen → feed loading

## 0:20–0:50 — The App in Action

"Here's FoodShare running on iOS — built entirely with Claude Code in one week."

**Show each screen for 3-4 seconds:**

1. **Feed** — scroll through food listings nearby
2. **Map** — tap to show map discovery view, zoom into pins
3. **Listing detail** — tap a food item, show photos, description, pickup info
4. **Messaging** — open a chat thread, show real-time conversation
5. **Create listing** — quick walkthrough of posting food (photo, title, category, location)
6. **Challenges** — show gamified challenges and streaks
7. **Forum** — community discussions
8. **Profile** — user profile with stats and reviews

## 0:50–1:20 — Cross-Platform (The Technical Story)

"What makes this different — this is a single Swift codebase that runs natively on both iOS and Android through Skip Fuse."

**Show in Xcode / editor:**

1. Open `Sources/FoodShare/` — "584 Swift files, roughly 198,000 lines of code"
2. Show a `#if !SKIP` guard — "iOS-only APIs like Metal shaders get guarded, with cross-platform alternatives for Android"
3. Show `Features/` directory — "24 feature modules, each with the same clean architecture layers"
4. Show `Core/Design/` — "137 Liquid Glass design components across 8 themes"

---

## 1:20–1:50 — Claude Code as the Builder

"Claude Code didn't just help — it was the primary development tool."

**Show in terminal / Claude Code:**

1. Show a Claude Code conversation or session — "I'd describe a feature, and Opus would generate the full stack: View, ViewModel, Repository, API Service"
2. Show the architecture consistency — "Look at any two features — they follow identical patterns. 584 files, zero drift."
3. Show `Core/Networking/` — "The entire networking layer — APIClient with retry logic, Supabase fallback, Edge Function response handling — all generated by Claude Code"

---

## 1:50–2:20 — The Backend

"The backend is 35 self-hosted Supabase Edge Functions."

**Show briefly:**

1. Terminal: list the 35 function directories
2. Open one Edge Function — show `createAPIHandler` pattern, structured logging
3. "Auth, search, AI recommendations, geocoding, notifications, multi-provider email failover — all built with Claude Code"

---

## 2:20–2:50 — The Numbers

"Let me put this in perspective."

**Show the stats (overlay or terminal):**

- 584 Swift files
- ~198,000 lines of code
- 24 feature modules
- 29 core infrastructure modules
- 137 design system components
- 35 backend Edge Functions
- 21 languages supported
- 2 platforms from 1 codebase
- 1 developer
- 1 week

## 2:50–3:00 — Close

"FoodShare proves that Claude Code doesn't just write code faster — it changes what's possible for a solo developer. One person, one week, a production app that fights food waste on both platforms."

**Show:** GitHub repo URL → app running

## Recording Tips

- Use QuickTime screen recording or OBS
- Record at 1080p minimum
- Keep voiceover natural, not scripted-sounding
- Move through screens briskly — don't linger
- Upload to YouTube (unlisted is fine) or Loom
